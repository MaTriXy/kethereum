This is a Kotlin library for [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org).
Currently it is not a full featured Ethereum implementation - but a library to share common Ethereum code between different apps to [prevent WET code and make things more DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Mainly in the context of the [WALLETH Project](https://walleth.org).
Later I could imagine that this extends to a full implementation of Ethereum in Kotlin. But as this would be a huge endeavour and I want to continue with my projects don't expect this in the near future - but I accept PRs ;-)
